# FakeNewsDetectorML

This project is a Machine Learning-based solution for detecting fake news articles. It includes:

- **Data Preprocessing:**  
  Cleaning, tokenization, removing stopwords, and transforming text for model compatibility.

- **Feature Engineering:**  
  Extraction of relevant features (e.g., TF-IDF, word embeddings) from article text.

- **Model Training:**  
  Multiple machine learning algorithms are implemented and compared, such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines.

- **Evaluation:**  
  Performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) for assessing model effectiveness.

  Albert has showcased the best results of >93% among the rest 3! (bert includes)!

- **Prediction:**  
  Interface for predicting the authenticity of new articles using the trained model.

Project was done in student group (me of course :D) as a part of exam!
